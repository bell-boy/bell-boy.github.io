# existential dread 

It's all because of cookie clicker. 

Recently, I've been playing it a lot more and a friend brought up the idea of trying to mathematically optimize the game. Naturally, the first thing I did was head to google scholar and search for cookie clicker research papers.

I found this pretty great Masters paper from MIT of all places, and wondered just what kind of legend spends two years to write a paper on optimizing a (very well made) idle game?

[Kai Xiao](https://kaixiao.github.io/) finished his undergrad in Mathematics and Computer Science and Ph.D in Computer Science (with a focus on robustness in machine learning) at MIT. During this time he interned at multiple quantitative trading firms, but he now works at OpenAI as a Technical Lead. 

This guy has lived a life damn near identical to the life I was planning to lead. Yet the end of his road doesn't seem that appealing. The worst part is that I can't quite put my finger on what bothers me about this. I've stalked Kai pretty extensively, and to me he seems like he's living his best life, but is that *my* best life?

Where do I see my self in 10, 20, 40, or 80 years?

## in search of an end goal

So what's my meaning of life to me? Fame, Fortune, Legacy?

I don't think either of these three will really satisfy me in the end. 
 - Seeking fortune simply delays the problem. When do I stop chasing more money? At a million, a billion? Even if I hit the magic number, what comes next? What do I do with all this money?
 - Fame feels like it'd get tiring quickly. I would get sick of all the shallow attention. Hell, I get sick of all the normal attention sometimes.
 - Legacy is the only thing that begins to tempt me.

## legacy

The closest thing we can have to immortality is a legacy. If we play our cards right, our impact might far outlive us. 

I want to leave an impact on the world before I die, but what does this impact matter when I'm dead? I don't want to do it for massive amounts of fame or money, some deeper need *calls* me to do it. 

I've thought about this a lot this week, and to chase this idea of "legacy", and "maximizing my impact" seems kind of silly. I rarely think about the people who you might regard as having the largest legacies (Steve Jobs, Issac Newton, MLK), but I do think a lot about the people who've astonished me with their breadth and depth of knowledge. I want to be more like that. Leaving an impact by how I do things, not what exactly I did. 

Not everyone might remember me or the things I did, but in the limit, we'll all be skeletons anyway. I won't live my life just so that Historians of Far Away Days deem me worthy of jotting down. 

## where to from here

So the answer is, just work on things I'm passionate about? 
But what am I *really* passionate about. New fields rise and fall, what do I want to spend my life doing?

I don't know! But what I do now is that I wouldn't let a version of me from 5 years ago control me right now, hell, I wouldn't let me 2 weeks ago control what I eat for breakfast. The same will probably hold true in the future.

Yet, my actions now have a direct impact on the options available to me in the future. I may not know where I want to go now, but I'll have more information later. So maybe the optimization target is "what can I do now that'll give me the most options in the future." (Paul Graham calls this [Staying upwind](https://paulgraham.com/hs.html))

# goals for 2024: the grand finale

I know what you're thinking. "Here we go, femi once again is moving the goal posts." But I feel shameless about constantly revising my goals like this. I'm always learning more about the world, and what I want to do. To be clear, I'm fine with revising longer term goals. I often fail to completely achieve my shorter term goals (\\(\le\\)  1 week), which I don't think I should revise at all. 

Goal for 2024: ***Learn a lot about a lot***

Sub goals:
1. Always be reading a new book/course on some generally useful topic.
2. Always be working on some generally useful project.
3. Maintain good grades (~3.8 GPA)
4. Read a research paper daily
5. Having fun - not just being a CS robot

I'll be focusing on broader projects and less on specific career paths. This means less of a focus on research (which has to be specific and targeted) and more of a focus just general learning (where I'm free to learn and explore).

Weekly goals:

1. Finish 2 Chapters of [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/)
2. Redesign UI for engineering project
3. Don't fail tests lol.
4. Write a blog post about continual learning
5. Read two chapters of [TSCM](https://www.amazon.com/Scout-Mindset-Perils-Defensive-Thinking/dp/0735217556)

You'll note that the bar here is signifcantly lower than other weeks. I'm accounting for ```RANDOM SHIT``` which seems to be a constant in my life. We'll see if I can get it done. As always, I'll let you know how it goes.
