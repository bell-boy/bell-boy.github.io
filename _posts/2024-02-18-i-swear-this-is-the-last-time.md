# new phone, who dis?

So yes, I was late. Again. However, this time I had a really good reason. As you can see I revamped the blog!

# reinventing the wheel

The pipeline I had created, generating static webpages from markdown files to run a blog, was the primary use case of jekyll. I spent all that time creating a shitty version of jekyll. Yes, I learned a lot, but I care more about my blog looking nice. I don't regret doing it though. The alternative was to hop directly into a full-fledged framework like react and flounder about without really knowing what I was doing. Doing everything from scratch made me realize that jekyll was the better framework for me. 

So I grabbed a theme and got to work. The original code is still available in my [github repo](https://bell-boy.github.io/0x100/) under a separate branch. Some (most) of the links might be broken as we make the transition. 0x00 didn't survive the jump :(. I'll take the time to fix everything later. This post is so late so I'll save most of what I have to say for 0x08. We'll see how it goes.
