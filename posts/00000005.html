<p>Hi! I've spent most of my free time building my final project for my engineering class. So after a quick productivity update, I'll spend most of this post detailing how that's going.  </p>


<h1>productivity</h1>


<p>I wish I was uploading this on Monday, but it is currently Wednesday the 31st. So I'll take a moment to reflect on the goals I set for the month, see how I did.</p>


<h2>i did pretty poorly</h2>


<p>Looking at my monthly goals...</p>


<ul><li>I did <em>not</em> read and explore AI papers daily</li><li>I did <em>not</em> participate in a kaggle competition</li><li>I did finish superforecasting!</li><li>I did make the blog look slightly better!</li></ul>


<p>The main reason I failed the first two was that I didn't really have a consistant time and place to do them in. Reading could be done with any bit of free time, and small updates to the blog can be done in a few lines of code. But reading a paper or building a model requires a long block of uninteruptted attention. During Febuary I want to have times and places where I do work everyday, regardless of what's going on. </p>


<p>Another problem was I didn't have a concrete problem I was solving. In Febuary I want to focus on clarifiying what the problems within my field are, previous approaches to tackling them, and directions to go forward. </p>


<p>Moving on to yearly goals...</p>


<ul><li>AI Research: I feel like I made little progress on this goal for the reasons stated previously.</li><li>Becoming A Better Engineer: Working on my engineering project has pushed me to grow in unexpected ways, so I'm happy with this one.</li><li>Getting 5s on my AP Exams: This is the goal I've probably made the least progress on. Like I said before, I just couldn't find the time to start studying. Hopefully that can change.</li><li>Executing my engineering capstone project well: As I said before, It's gone well. However, I think I'll fold this goal into my second goal. </li><li>Gaining 30lbs: I cannot go to the gym consistantly. It's not possible without a car. This goal might have to be put on hold.</li><li>Reading More: There are three types of books I read. Non-fiction techincal, Non-fiction non-techincal, fiction. I'm reading plenty of non-technical literature, but I don't think I've dedicated enough to for technical reading.</li></ul>


<h2>goals for feb</h2>


<ul><li>Finish <a href="https://course.aisafetyfundamentals.com/alignment">AI Safety Fundamentals</a></li><li>Finish <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/">MIT Bio</a></li><li>Finish my engineering project</li><li>Finish Scout Mindset by Julia Galef</li><li>Finish 3 Blog TODO list items</li></ul>


<h2>goals for this week</h2>


<ul><li>Finish Session 1 of AISF</li><li>Finish the Biochemistry unit of bio</li><li>Finish my model architecture and get a music free prototype of the game working</li><li>Give my markdown parser the ability to deal with YAML front matter</li></ul>


<h1>the engineering project </h1>


<p>so the core functionality of my engineering project is a <em>monophonic music transcription system</em>. Which means that it takes in a musical recording from a single instrument and writes down the music.</p>


<p>The approach I chose is based on machine learning, but the hard part isn’t the machine learning. It’s getting the data in the proper format that makes the project difficult. </p>


<p>The ML model is based on <a href="https://ismir2018.ismir.net/doc/pdfs/87_Paper.pdf">this</a> paper which uses an architecture based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02595.pdf">DeepSpeech2</a> a system that converts <em>speech</em> to text. I’ve made a couple of modifications to the architecture that i’ll go into detail about in a later post. </p>


<p>What really shocked me about this whole process was that the researchers behind the first paper went through a long, difficult process to build the dataset they used to train the model and they <em>didn’t publish it</em>. Creating model is the easy part, just <em>getting the data</em> has been the hard part.</p>


<h2>gigabytes of struggle</h2>


<p>The data comes mostly from the <a href="https://opac.rism.info/main-menu-/kachelmenu/data">RISM</a> dataset. RISM (Répertoire International des Sources Musicales) is an “international, non-profit organization that aims to comprehensively document extant musical sources worldwide.” Being international, the website was not in english, and I lost my shit trying to navigate it.</p>


<p>Then, the actual data. It felt like it was impossible to find a link to download the actual dataset and I spent hours trying to work with their online system. I was so frustrated with it all. </p>


<p>Until I found the english button on the website.</p>


<p>After I got over feeling stupid. I downloaded the data and struggled to understand it's format (the link to the formatting rules were in French). Most of the data in the dataset was irrelevent. So I had to write code to take the bits of music I cared about. Once I had all these bits, I converted them to audio recordings using a super fucked processing pipeline. After 10 hours of switching between coding and googling, I had about 160GB of audio data. Yet my suffering still isn't over, because I still have to convert the bits to a format the model can and process and understand. </p>


<p>All this headache, all this suffering, because the researchers couldn't be bothered to publish their dataset. I have a lot more to do, so i'll let you know how it goes. </p>
