# 0x6

This is going to be a short post, we have a busy week ahead.

# productivity check in

Last weeks goals:
* didn't finish session 1
* didn't finish the biochem unit 
* didn't finish the markdown parser
* didn't finish writing the model for my enigneering project

Welp, seems like a whole heep of failure. However it wasn't for lack of trying. I underestimated the time needed to finish the model for my engineering project, and spent most of my time doing that instead of focusing on other goals. I've made enough progress on the model to where I think I can just move over last week's goals to this week. I'll let you know how it goes.
