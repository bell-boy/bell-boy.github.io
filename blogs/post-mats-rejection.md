title: Post MATS rejection
---

So I was just rejected from Neel Nanda's MATS stream... for the 3rd time.

I applied twice when I was 17, and once just recently. I would say each time my application got markedly better, however, so did the applicant pool. This time was particularly crushing, since I felt that my application was the strongest it had ever been -- this was the closest I felt to being a "real researcher".

But, if I'm being honest, I don't think I've ever really done enough to get good at mech interp. I would say maybe somewhere around 30% of the knowledge I have around mech interp I gained a week before turning in the application. I wasn't too suprised at the rejection, but I was suprised at the astrisk that came with it.

If my casual interactions w/ mech interp over the past couple of months were enough to get me to the border between rejection and acceptance, what would be the effects of three weeks of dedicated effort?

That's what this post is, me detailing the process of working through Neel's [training phase](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S7Jpr1-vbcH_q787UNDyW6654ksjjH39iqfpISicLP0/edit#heading=h.k9sth71rpfgu) on my own.  

# Week One

The first two weeks of Neel's stream is the education phase, just skilling up and learning more about the field. The first thing I decided to do was compelete everything on the [fundamentals checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/165GByHa8r5NYzPvWqadMPMrsqzY6ckFgL-yUC9jT3mw/edit) he provides.

I finish most of the items in one day, however, the last item did not work.
