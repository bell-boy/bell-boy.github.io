One of the saddest things psycology teaches is that the big five personality traits are essentially immutatable [citation needed].

This personally sucks. I am in the bottom quartile for conscientiousness, and its had predictable effects on my productivity. So I've recently begun thinking, "What mental prosthetics can I give myself to allow me to be as productive as someone much more conscientious then I am?"

This post serves as a log of various experiments I've tried. I'm sharing this in the hope that someone else can start from a less painful place then I did. 

# Background

I've been thinking about how to maximize productivity for a while now, and going into this I had some pre-existing notions.

- If you're going to school, have a job, or some other large obligation, you can only really refine (to the ~99th percentile) a small (n â‰ˆ 3) subset of skills.
- Most people are very unproductive
- My mental model of people who are typically good at a skill is "I just do it whenever I feel like it," but they tend to feel like it a lot (<40%) of the time.[^1]
- Returns to effort are diminishing.

If it's relevant, I'm a undergraduate student who's taught himself to program (maybe ~90th percentile for age group?) and have mostly failed at mastering other skills (though I can draw better than most people).

# Metrics

How do we measure productivity? A common metric is money per unit time, however, it can be hard to reason about the monetary value of various projects. What's the value of a 4.0 gpa? A side project? A research paper? I don't know how to answer these questions, so I instead approach things differently. 

I seperate my life into 2 spheres, academic and extracurricular. The goal is to maximize academic grades and value created in the extracurricular sphere while minimizing time spent on academics.

That provides a pretty good metric for academic productivity per unit of time. Grade per hours studied, but I don't expect this to be constant.

I think a reasonable model for the effect of hours studied on grades is a bounded exponetial, i.e. \\( 100(1 - e^{kx}) \\), where \\( k \\) is some constant that varies dependant on the study method. So we can compare study methods based on their \\( k \\), where larger \\( k \\) means we get to spend less time studying for the exact same grade.
