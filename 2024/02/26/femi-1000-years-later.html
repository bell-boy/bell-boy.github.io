<p>It’s all because of cookie clicker.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve been playing it a lot more and a friend brought up the idea of trying to mathematically optimize the game. Naturally, the first thing I did was head to google scholar and search for cookie clicker research papers.</p>

<p>I found this pretty great Masters paper from MIT of all places, and wondered just what kind of legend spends two years to write a paper on optimizing a (very well made) idle game?</p>

<p><a href="https://kaixiao.github.io/">Kai Xiao</a> finished his undergrad in Mathematics and Computer Science and Ph.D in Computer Science (with a focus on robustness in machine learning) at MIT. During this time he interned at multiple quantitative trading firms, but he now works at OpenAI as a Technical Lead.</p>

<p>This guy has lived a life damn near identical to the life I was planning to lead. Yet the end of his road doesn’t seem that appealing. The worst part is that I can’t quite put my finger on what bothers me about this. I’ve stalked Kai pretty extensively, and to me he seems like he’s living his best life, but is that <em>my</em> best life?</p>

<p>Where do I see my self in 10, 20, 40, or 80 years?</p>

<h2 id="in-search-of-an-end-goal">in search of an end goal</h2>

<p>So what’s my meaning of life to me? Fame, Fortune, Legacy?</p>

<p>I don’t think either of these three will really satisfy me in the end.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Seeking fortune simply delays the problem. When do I stop chasing more money? At a million, a billion? Even if I hit the magic number, what comes next? What do I do with all this money?</li>
  <li>Fame feels like it’d get tiring quickly. I would get sick of all the shallow attention. Hell, I get sick of all the normal attention sometimes.</li>
  <li>Legacy is the only thing that begins to tempt me.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="legacy">legacy</h2>

<p>The closest thing we can have to immortality is a legacy. If we play our cards right, our impact might far outlive us.</p>

<p>I want to leave an impact on the world before I die, but what does this impact matter when I’m dead? I don’t want to do it for massive amounts of fame or money, some deeper need <em>calls</em> me to do it.</p>

<p>I’ve thought about this a lot this week, and to chase this idea of “legacy”, and “maximizing my impact” seems kind of silly. I rarely think about the people who you might regard as having the largest legacies (Steve Jobs, Issac Newton, MLK), but I do think a lot about the people who’ve astonished me with their breadth and depth of knowledge. I want to be more like that. Leaving an impact by how I do things, not what exactly I did.</p>

<p>Not everyone might remember me or the things I did, but in the limit, we’ll all be skeletons anyway. I won’t live my life just so that Historians of Far Away Days deem me worthy of jotting down.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-from-here">where to from here</h2>

<p>So the answer is, just work on things I’m passionate about? 
But what am I <em>really</em> passionate about. New fields rise and fall, what do I want to spend my life doing?</p>

<p>I don’t know! But what I do now is that I wouldn’t let a version of me from 5 years ago control me right now, hell, I wouldn’t let me 2 weeks ago control what I eat for breakfast. The same will probably hold true in the future.</p>

<p>Yet, my actions now have a direct impact on the options available to me in the future. I may not know where I want to go now, but I’ll have more information later. So maybe the optimization target is “what can I do now that’ll give me the most options in the future.” (Paul Graham calls this <a href="https://paulgraham.com/hs.html">Staying upwind</a>)</p>

<h1 id="goals-for-2024-the-grand-finale">goals for 2024: the grand finale</h1>

<p>I know what you’re thinking. “Here we go, femi once again is moving the goal posts.” But I feel shameless about constantly revising my goals like this. I’m always learning more about the world, and what I want to do. To be clear, I’m fine with revising longer term goals. I often fail to completely achieve my shorter term goals (\(\le\)  1 week), which I don’t think I should revise at all.</p>

<p>Goal for 2024: <strong><em>Learn a lot about a lot</em></strong></p>

<p>Sub goals:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Always be reading a new book/course on some generally useful topic.</li>
  <li>Always be working on some generally useful project.</li>
  <li>Maintain good grades (~3.8 GPA)</li>
  <li>Read a research paper daily</li>
  <li>Having fun - not just being a CS robot</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ll be focusing on broader projects and less on specific career paths. This means less of a focus on research (which has to be specific and targeted) and more of a focus just general learning (where I’m free to learn and explore).</p>

<p>Weekly goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Finish 2 Chapters of <a href="https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/">Understanding Deep Learning</a></li>
  <li>Redesign UI for engineering project</li>
  <li>Don’t fail tests lol.</li>
  <li>Write a blog post about continual learning</li>
  <li>Read two chapters of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scout-Mindset-Perils-Defensive-Thinking/dp/0735217556">TSCM</a></li>
</ol>

<p>You’ll note that the bar here is signifcantly lower than other weeks. I’m accounting for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RANDOM SHIT</code> which seems to be a constant in my life. We’ll see if I can get it done. As always, I’ll let you know how it goes.</p>
